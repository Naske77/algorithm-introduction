# The topic of the Algorithm is English_Sentence

## On the VAR:

## In the sentence our String was N, BECAUSE THE N was undefined where N is the length of the string..

## The Sentence length was INTEGER :=1

## The Word_Count was an INTEGER with the value of 1

## Vowel_count wass also an INTEGER ie each vowel was +1...

## While the Vowels was a STRING which identified the vowels in the sentence.

## However, the (i)index is from 0 to [N-1]. since N is undefined, we used -1 which create an array to give space for more datas to be added.

# STEP 1:

## If there are Vowels in the sentence,then Vowel_count will be +1 eg: "Hello World" Vowel_count would be (e, o, o) = 3

# END_IF

## If the sentence has a space, "do not include" THEN countinue sentence_len from +1.eg: Sentence_len excluding spaces "Hello World" = 10

# ELSE

## word_count takes each word as 1 without the space eg:"Hello, World" so word_count = 2
